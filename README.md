## Image Caption Generator
Image Caption Generator is the project I have done during my Artificial Intelligence internship at CodersCave.

🔍 **Objective:** Generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning.

🛠 **Technologies Used:**
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

📝 **Description:**
Developed a deep learning model that generates descriptive captions for images. Combined computer vision techniques with natural language processing to create an image captioning system.
